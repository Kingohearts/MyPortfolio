	<h2>What i like</h2>
<div class="tech-love">
	<p>I am  interested in both front end and back end web development frameworks. Some of my favourite webdevelopment frameworks to develop in are <strong>Ruby on rails</strong> and <strong>node js</strong>. i like Ruby on rails for its fast development time and good framework convention which is slightly beginner friendly . Node js is great because i am somewhat experience in javascript language and developing both front end , back end in same language helps in maintaining integrity of the application. Not to forget the fact that its non blocking request reception style also results often in highly improvised performance(speed) of the website. </p>
